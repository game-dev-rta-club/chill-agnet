  Experimental Claude Auto mode continues through a verified main Stop, once per
  meaningful revision. It preserves Off, continuation Pause, pending feedback and
  uncertain reservations. Native packaged qualification passes; explicit project hook setup is available.

# Qualify Auto mode in a Claude conversation

This development route uses the same Auto mode guidance and revision allowance
as Codex, but a different native delivery mechanism. The composed runtime registers
`lib/claude-continuation.mjs` through the CLI's optional `connection-hooks`
capability. Codex remains the default setup route. Experimental native project hooks
use explicit `setup prepare --harness claude-code --project /absolute/project`.
Setup does not enable Auto mode or change native permissions. This route is not
advertised as a supported Claude Web control.

Prepare the composed runtime in an isolated data directory. Configure the CLI's
`connection claude-hook` for SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop and
SessionEnd. Create a new Root through its main-hook action protocol. In that same
main conversation, using the prepared launcher:

```sh
chill monitor enable --id <ROOT>
chill monitor disable --id <ROOT>
chill monitor pause --id <ROOT>
chill monitor resume --id <ROOT>
```

Each mutation needs native main-hook confirmation. `pause` holds **future automatic
continuations**; it does not interrupt Claude. Enabling does not release a pause
or reset history. The existing Web polling scheduler, `start`, `tick` and `watch`
do not drive this experimental route. No new native process is launched.

## Continue once and account for the result

At a verified main Stop, the extension checks saved feedback and holds across
every Root in this native connection. Off, Pause, unprocessed input and uncertain
prior requests suppress continuation. The extension saves one attempt before the
CLI returns a native Stop decision. It links the packaged combined continuation
and stopping-review guide, without claiming that native input queues are empty.
Claude retains its input ordering and tool permission policy.

The Agent reports the exact attempt through `monitor result`. That receipt must
be confirmed by the main hook; the response must then reach a matching Stop.
Only both facts complete the attempt. A lost output or missing receipt is never
blindly retried, even after a revision change or through another Root. One check
consumes the allowance for that revision; comments, results and Off/On toggles
do not create another allowance. Substantive Goal, Brief or user-input changes
can create the next one after the preceding attempt is resolved.

An optional finite feedback watcher shares Stop ownership with this route. A
continuation cancels its old checkpoint. A feedback offer that wins first blocks
Auto mode until processed. The continued prompt receives new Web replies at its
next ordinary tool hook, preserving uncertain-offer deduplication.

## Reproduce the native check

After building this repository, run from the CLI source checkout:

```sh
node scripts/probe-claude-auto.mjs --run --runtime /absolute/path/to/chill-agent/dist/runtime --auth-settings /absolute/path/to/native-settings.json
```

The probe copies the composed runtime to a disposable data directory and uses its
stable launcher. It creates a Root, enables Auto mode and finishes the initial
response. The native Stop continues that same process; the Agent reads the Goal
index/context, retains an initial memory token and reports the attempt. A second
Stop consumes it without another nudge. The script limits print-mode model cost
to $0.75 and runtime to 120 seconds, imports explicit native authentication only
into memory, and removes temporary files. It does not alter ordinary settings.

Claude Code 2.1.289 passed all 13 checks on 2026-10-06. The continuation kept the
same native prompt ID and needed no new user input. Local tests additionally cover
concurrent/repeated Stops, Off/Pause, pending input in other Roots, resumed feedback,
subagents, clear, unknown output and delayed receipts.

The additional `--setup-resume` probe first saves an earlier conversation without
chill hooks ($0.15/45-second bound), installs experimental project hooks through
the packaged setup command, and resumes that same native session. On the same
version/date all 15 checks passed, including the earlier memory token, one Root,
one continuation and preservation of unrelated local settings. The default
$0.75/120-second bound applies to the resumed phase. The initial test allow rule
needed command-quoting alignment; native permissions were not broadened.

These checks qualify disposable print-mode flows, not permanent idle delivery,
hot-installation into a running conversation, general execution cancellation or
production setup. Those remain separate work. The boundary contract is the
[CLI connection-hook guide](https://github.com/game-dev-rta-club/chill-agent-cli/blob/main/docs/extensions/connection-hooks.md).
