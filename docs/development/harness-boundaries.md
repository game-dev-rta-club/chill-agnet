  enforcement. Add a harness through one registry, not host branches in references.

# Separate harness behavior from the skill

The audit found host branches in connection setup, Goal creation, feedback intake,
work selection and the standalone starter. The shared skill should not need to
know which host has a durable Queue or a main-tool confirmation protocol.

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Skill and action references | Outcomes, scope, feedback priority, useful results and common interface entry |
| `session guide --harness <id>` | Read-only selected operations, confirmation rules, next actions and constraints |
| `extensions/harnesses/<id>.mjs` | Host-specific setup options and operation guidance |
| `session start` | Common isolated preparation and Web reuse; returns the selected interface |
| CLI native implementation | Identity capture, Hook installation, receipt validation, actual transport and recovery |

A runtime adapter is trusted application code registered in
[the registry](../../extensions/harnesses/index.mjs). Input selects a known ID, never a
module path. Unknown IDs fail before setup; there is no default to another host.
The application registers `session` as a CLI extension command. Both standalone
and plugin skills reach this same interface through their small bundled entry.
Existing CLI commands remain compatible; this change does not rewrite transport
or change the saved Root's owner.

## Use the contract

Read `session guide` before first use. Use its operation command suffix with the
established stable prefix. `operations` names creation, receipt, inspection and
work-selection routes; absent/null operations are unsupported. A pending marker
is not success: follow each operation's confirmation rule. Next actions cover
native activation; constraints retain the connection's operational limits.
The agent still identifies its actual calling host and native project directory.
The runtime does not infer identity from a model name, current Goal or directory.

Codex supports durable deferred receipts and work selection. Claude requires
main-session confirmation and has no deferred Queue or work heartbeat. Those
are meaningful differences, so the interface exposes them rather than pretending
both hosts share the same side effects. Current incoming feedback already carries
host-selected receipt commands; references follow those instructions without
repeating the host branches.

## Add a host

Implement and qualify the native CLI connection first. Add one adapter with its
ID, setup options and guidance, then register it. Test missing capabilities,
confirmation boundaries, unknown-host rejection and preservation of the selected
workspace. No existing common reference or standalone entry needs a host branch.
Keep user-facing platform instructions in user documentation, separate from the
shared agent skill. The [native interface probe](claude-plugin.md#verify-the-selected-runtime-interface)
checks the selected runtime response and saved native ownership. Older probes
that assert a removed host-specific Markdown read are historical evidence only.

Current verification covers routing, setup option retention, workspace isolation,
Web reuse, packaged command availability and a disposable native Claude skill
invocation through the interface. It does not qualify another host or replace
interactive first-use approval and long-running reception tests.
