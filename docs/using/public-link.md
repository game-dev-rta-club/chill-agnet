  More → Public link opens access controls and a phone QR. Temporary links expose the
  workspace; fixed URLs and Access are prepared in the user's own Cloudflare CLI.

# Open the workspace on your phone

On your computer, choose **More → Public link** and turn it On. Confirm the
scope, then scan the QR with your phone's camera. **Copy link** offers the same
address. The **More** link inside that panel explains access and custom URLs.

Temporary links need `cloudflared` installed. They expose every Goal in this
workspace, including replies, to anyone with the link. Off closes the tunnel
while the local Web stays available. It preserves the saved custom connection
and notification registrations. A connection failure leaves local Web usable
and does not silently switch a custom connection to a temporary one.

The computer and server must stay running. Prepared Web updates use
`chill server restart --configured`: the public link stays the same while Web
restarts. Public Off, full server stop, or restarting the computer closes the
connection. The first update from the old server-owned connection changes the
URL once. A temporary URL changes when the
tunnel restarts; open the new QR and reconnect phone notifications. Use a fixed
URL to keep the address. Cloudflare's Quick Tunnel service is intended for
trying things, without an uptime guarantee.

## Keep a fixed URL

Prepare this in your own terminal and Cloudflare account. The Web never asks
for an account API token. You need a Cloudflare account, a domain managed there,
`cloudflared`, and a locally managed named tunnel. Dashboard token tunnels are
not supported by this connector.

1. Follow [Cloudflare's local tunnel guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/features/locally-managed-tunnels/create-local-tunnel/):
   run `cloudflared tunnel login`, then `cloudflared tunnel create chill-agent`.
   Keep the generated credentials file on this computer.
2. Create a [self-hosted Access application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/self-hosted-public-app/)
   for your chosen hostname, with an Allow policy for the people who may enter.
   Configure the identity provider or email one-time PIN as needed. A tunnel
   alone does not restrict access. Record the Access team name and application AUD.
3. After Access is ready, connect DNS with
   `cloudflared tunnel route dns <TUNNEL-ID> chill.example.com`.
4. Run `chill settings remote --help` for the current JSON format. Save a local
   file containing the fixed HTTPS URL, tunnel ID, credentials-file **path**,
   Access team name and AUD, then apply it with
   `chill settings remote --file /absolute/path/to/remote.json`.
5. In the Public link panel, turn Off and On to use the saved connection. It should
   show your saved hostname. Verify the link on your phone and verify that an
   unauthorized signed-in user is denied before sharing it.

The account management certificate (`cert.pem`) and per-tunnel credentials
have different powers. Do not paste either file into a chat or Web form.
The connector uses the per-tunnel file path and checks Access JWTs at ingress.
See [Cloudflare's credential explanation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/features/locally-managed-tunnels/tunnel-permissions/).

A server launched with `--configured` resumes the saved public On/Off choice.
`--local` starts with public access Off. The panel can start or stop the tunnel
without restarting Web. CLI-only distributions use their own server lifecycle;
follow their installed help.

Public access and [notifications](notifications.md) are independent. Push can
still arrive while the public link is Off, but opening the Goal then needs the
public link to be running. Access-protected phone delivery and login may depend
on the browser; verify the end-to-end experience on your own device.
