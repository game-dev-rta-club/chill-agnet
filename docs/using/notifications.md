  Each browser receives Letters for a Root. On sends one setup confirmation; Off
  leaves other devices unchanged. Changing the public URL retires old registrations.

# Hear when your attention matters

Open a Goal and choose **More → Notifications**. Turn On and allow the browser's
permission request. A confirmation arrives a few seconds later. Tap it to return
to the Goal. This browser will receive Letters for that project (the
Root Goal and its children).

Each device has its own switch. Turn Off on your phone to stop phone alerts;
your computer's choice stays unchanged. A new browser or project starts Off.

For your phone, open **More → Public link** on your computer and scan its QR. On iPhone,
add the page to your Home Screen and open that app first. Then turn On in the
phone's Notifications panel. Permission belongs to that browser and URL. If previously
blocked, change the browser's site settings before trying again.

## Control interruptions

The Agent notifies saved Letters using `settings notice`. Comments, progress,
Brief saves and AutoContinue checks do not send Web notifications, even if the
Agent asks to notify a Comment. The one-time confirmation after turning On is
only a setup check. On does not replay old posts. Off cancels this device's pending
notifications; a request already handed to the push service can still arrive.
It retains the registration and browser permission for later use.

Delivery receipts remain internal. Push-service acceptance alone does not prove
an alert appeared; browser and OS settings can suppress banners. Failed or
uncertain sends are not automatically retried. Reconnecting an expired
subscription requires turning On again.

The computer must be awake and able to reach the push service. Closing the Web
page does not prevent delivery. Keys and subscriptions stay in local data
outside the repository, with private file permissions.

## Public access is separate

The [Public link panel](public-link.md) opens or closes phone access. Notifications Off
does not close it. While the public link is Off, alerts may arrive but their
Goal links cannot open remotely. A different temporary URL needs a fresh phone
registration. Once a new public URL is confirmed, registrations for the previous
URL stop receiving notifications. This avoids sending to both an old and a new
subscription on the same phone. Other devices registered at the current URL
remain independent; the app does not guess which physical device a browser is.
A fixed URL avoids that change.

Registering the same push subscription again keeps a single recipient, even if
site storage was reset. Preparing the same Letter more than once also sends it
only once per subscription. A single phone using separate browser profiles can
still have separate registrations; turn Off in any profile you do not want.

Existing host-tool notification profiles remain available through the CLI and
message-setup skill. Once Web notifications are chosen for a Root, turning its
last device Off does not fall back to an external profile. The standalone CLI
has no Web Push policy; chill-agent's extensions supply it.

Letters have one presentation and Answer action. Ordinary outcomes are saved as
Comments and remain silent under the Letter-only notification preference.
Historical no-reply Letters retain their original pending-count behavior, but
are no longer presented as a separate kind of message. Reading a result does
not gate the next agreed action.
